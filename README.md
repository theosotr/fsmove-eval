# Artifact for "Practical Fault Detection in Puppet Programs" (ICSE'20)

This is the artifact for the ICSE'20 paper
"Practical Fault Detection in Puppet Programs".

A pre-print of the paper is available [here](https://dimitro.gr/assets/papers/SMS20.pdf).


# Requirements

* A Unix-like operating system (tested on Ubuntu).

* An installation of Docker (Please, follow the instructions from
  the official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)).

* At least 35GB of available disk space.


# Setup

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)
# Getting Started

## Navigating through the Docker Image

Before running our examples,
let's explore the contents of our freshly-created Docker
image.
Run the following command to create a new container.
```bash
docker run -ti --rm  --security-opt seccomp:unconfined fsmove
```
After executing the command,
you will be able to enter the home directory
(i.e., `/home/fsmove`) of the `fsmove` user.
This directory contains the `fsmove_src`
where the source code of our tool is stored.

To build `FSMoVe` on your own, run
```bash
fsmove@606771a763fd:~$ cd ~/fsmove_src
fsmove@606771a763fd:~$ dune clean
fsmove@606771a763fd:~$ dune build -p fsmove
fsmove@606771a763fd:~$ dune install
```

For running tests, execute
```bash
fsmove@606771a763fd:~$ dune runtest
```
This will produce something that is similar to the following
```
fsmove@606771a763fd:~$ dune runtest
run_tests alias fsmove_src/test/runtest
................................................................
Ran: 64 tests in: 0.11 seconds.
OK
```

### Usage

```
fsmove@9babcfdeb960:~/fsmove_src$ fsmove -help

                           (alias: -?)

```

After examining the source code
of `FSMoVe`, you can exit from the Docker container
by running
```bash
fsmove@606771a763fd:~$ exit
```

## Running the first examples

### Example1: Setup a MySQL DB

Inside the `example/` directory of the artifact,
there is one simple Puppet script,
namely `example/mysql_db.pp`.
This Puppet script
installs the `mysql-common` and `mysql-server` packages,
configures the file `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`
with the desired contents,
and initializes the MySQL database by
running the `sudo mysqld --initialize` command.
In particular,
the contents of `example/mysql_db.pp` are
```puppet
$packages = ['mysql-common','mysql-server']
package {$packages:
  ensure => installed
}

$my_cnf_contents = "[mysqld]
!includedir /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/
!includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/
innodb_buffer_pool_size=7GB
innodb_log_file_size=256M
key_buffer_size=5GB
log_error=/var/log/mysql/error.log"

file {'/etc/mysql/my.cnf':
  ensure  => 'file',
  content => $my_cnf_contents,
  require => [Package['mysql-server'], Package['mysql-common']]
}

exec {'Initialize MySQL DB':
  command => 'sudo mysqld --initialize',
  path    => '/bin:/usr/bin',
  require => [Package['mysql-server'], Package['mysql-common']]
}
```
The Puppet script above contains a fault
that we are going to detect using `FSMoVe`.
We will use the Docker image created
in a previous step in order to run
and analyze this Puppet script.
To do so,
run the following command
```bash
docker run -ti --rm  \
  --security-opt seccomp:unconfined \
  -v $(pwd)/example/mysql_db.pp:/home/fsmove/init.pp \
  -v "$(pwd)"/out:/home/fsmove/data fsmove \
  -m mysql-db -i no -s
```
This command will execute the `example/mysql_db.pp` script
inside a Docker container through `FSMoVe`.
Our tool will analyze its execution trace,
and will finally report the detected faults.
This command takes around 1-2 minutes.

Below, we provide the details of
our command.

* `--security-opt` (Docker option): This option
  enables system call tracing
  inside the Docker container.
* `-v` (Docker option): Through the option `-v`,
  we mount two local files inside the container.
  First, we mount the script located
  in `$(pwd)/example/mysql_db.pp`
  into `/home/fsmove/init.pp` that
  corresponds to the location
  where the container tries to find
  the entrypoint Puppet script
  that we want to analyze.
  Second, we mount the directory `$(pwd)/out`
  into `/home/fsmove/data`.
  All the analysis results
  produced during the execution of this container
  are stored in the local directory`$(pwd)/out`.
* `-m` (Image option): This option takes the name
  of the module as it is specified in [Forge API](https://forge.puppet.com/).
  In this example, we provide an arbitrary module name,
  because the provided Puppet script does not exist in Forge API.
* `-i` (Image option): This option indicates if we must install
  the Puppet module from Forge API before proceeding to the analysis.
  Available options are `no`, `latest`, and `<version-number>`.
  In this example, we provided `-i no`,
  because this Puppet script does not appear in Forge API.
  Therefore, we do not need to install it.
* `-s` (Image option): This flag indicates that we must monitor
  the execution of Puppet script using `FSMoVe`.
  Absence of this flag applies Puppet script without monitoring.

After the aforementioned command exits,
you can examine the results of the analysis
inside the `$(pwd)/out/` directory.
In particular,
the command produces the following six (6) files:
* `mysql-db.json`: the compiled catalog of the corresponding Puppet module.
* `mysql-db.strace`: a system call trace produced by `strace`.
* `mysql-db.size`: the size of system call trace (in bytes)
* `application.time`: time spent to apply the module.
* `mysql-db.times`: time spent on trace analysis and fault detection.
* `mysql-db.faults`: faults detected by `FSMoVe`.


The contents of `mysql-db.faults` are similar to the following:
```bash
Start executing manifest /home/fsmove/init.pp ...
Missing Ordering Relationships:
===============================
Number of MOR: 1
Pairs:
  * File[/etc/mysql/my.cnf]: /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/manifests/init.pp: 14
  * Exec[Initialize MySQL DB]: /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/manifests/init.pp: 20 =>
      Conflict on 1 resources:
      - /etc/mysql/my.cnf: Produced by File[/etc/mysql/my.cnf] ( rename at line 169402 ) and Consumed by Exec[Initialize MySQL DB] ( open at line 169990 )

Analysis time: 55.138767004
```
In particular,
`FSMoVe` detects one missing ordering relationship
between the Puppet resource `File[/etc/mysql/my.cnf]`
(defined at line 14 of the given Puppet script),
and the resource `Exec[Initialize MySQL DB]`
(defined at line 20).
These resources are conflicting on one file,
and there is no dependency between them.
Specifically,
`File[/etc/mysql/my.cnf]` produces the file `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`,
while `Exec[Initialize MySQL DB]` consumes the same file.
For debugging purposes,
`FSMoVe` also reports the system call
and the corresponding line in `mysql-db.strace`.
For example, `( rename at line 169402 )`
indicates that `File[/etc/mysql/my.cnf]` produced
`/etc/mysql/my.cnf` by calling the `rename()` system call
as it appears at line 169402 of
the corresponding `strace` file.
Note that in this example,
`FSMoVe` employs an _online_ analysis.
This means that it applies the given Puppet manifest
in parallel with trace analysis.
Therefore,
the `Analysis time` shown in the report above
corresponds to the overall time,
i.e., Puppet execution time, trace analysis time,
and fault detection time.

For more details about this fault,
see the first motivating example
described in our paper (Section 2).

### Example2: Running and analyzing a real-world Puppet module

It's time to run and analyze a real-world Puppet module,
namely [alertlogic-al_agents](https://forge.puppet.com/alertlogic/al_agents),
using `FSMoVe`.
Again,
we will use our Docker image `fsmove`
to spawn a fresh Puppet environment.
Run the following command
```bash
cd ~/fsmove-eval
docker run -ti --rm  \
  --security-opt seccomp:unconfined \
  -v "$(pwd)"/out:/home/fsmove/data fsmove \
  -m alertlogic-al_agents -i 0.2.0 -s
```
Notice that this time,
we provided the option `-i 0.2.0`,
as we need to install the `alertlogic-al_agents` module
(version 0.2.0) in the system,
before proceeding to the analysis.
As already discussed,
this module is taken
from [Forge API](https://forge.puppet.com/alertlogic/al_agents).
Also,
notice that this time
we did not mount any file into
`/home/fsmove/init.pp`,
because the container creates it automatically
after the installation of the `alertlogic-al_agents` module.

After the completion of the command above
(it takes 1-2 minutes),
we are now ready to examine the fault detection results
stored inside the `$(pwd)/out/` directory.
The contents of `out/alertlogic-al_agents.faults` file
are
```bash
Start executing manifest /home/fsmove/init.pp ...
Missing Ordering Relationships:
===============================
Number of MOR: 1
Pairs:
  * Exec[download]: /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/modules/al_agents/manifests/install.pp: 7
  * Package[al-agent]: /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/modules/al_agents/manifests/install.pp: 24 => 
      Conflict on 1 resources:
      - /tmp/al-agent: Produced by Exec[download] ( open at line 46027 ) and Consumed by Package[al-agent] ( open at line 54187 )

Analysis time: 23.1748681068
```
Notably,
`FSMoVe` detects one ordering violation,
between `Exec[download]` and `Package[al-agent]` resources.
For more details about this fault,
see Section 6.3.1 of our paper.

# Benchmarks

The artifact also includes one directory:
`benchmarks/`.
The directory includes
34 sub-directories representing
the Puppet modules listed in Table 1 of our paper.
Each directory contains the `init.pp` file
corresponding to the entrypoint script for executing the
module inside the container,
and the `params.txt` file contains parameters for
setting up the environment properly.
For example,
the following `params.txt` shows that
the script needs to install `albatrossflavour-os_patching`
(version 0.11.2) inside
the `/home/fsmove/.puppet/etc/code/modules` directory.
```bash
version: 0.11.2
modulepath: /home/fsmove/.puppet/etc/code/modules
modulename: albatrossflavour-os_patching
```
Some modules optionally contain a custom script
named `pre-script.sh`.
In this case,
the container runs the provided script,
before the execution and analysis of
the corresponding Puppet module.

To run the benchmarks, execute the following script:
```bash
cd ~/fsmove-eval
./scripts/run-benchmarks.sh
```
This script will take 20-50 minutes depending on your machine.
It produces a directory
(namely `benchmark-results`)
that contains the analysis results
for every benchmark.
Each sub-directory contains the six files produced from the analysis
of the corresponding module.
The script also generates the `benchmark-results/faults.csv`
file that shows the occurrence of each fault type
in every benchmark.

If you want to run a specific benchmark
(e.g., albatrossflavour-os_patching),
then simply run
```
./scripts/run-benchamrks.sh albatrossflavour-os_patching
```

*NOTE*: Some catalog applications are not deterministic;
thus there might be a slight variation is some modules.

# Trace Dataset

For further offline trace analysis,
we also provide the traces and compiled catalogs
stemming from the execution of all Puppet modules
examined in our evaluation.
Dataset URL: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3626750

You can download the dataset of traces
as follows
```bash
cd ~/fsmove-eval
wget -O traces.tar.gz "https://zenodo.org/record/3626750/files/traces.tar.gz?download=1"
tar -xvf traces.tar.gz
```

To analyze all traces using `FSMoVe`,
create a container,
and enter container's shell
by running the following command
from the root directory of the artifact.
```bash
docker run -ti --rm  \
  --security-opt seccomp:unconfined \
  -v $(pwd)/scripts:/home/fsmove/scripts \
  -v $(pwd)/traces:/home/fsmove/traces fsmove
```
Then, run the following command from the newly-created container
```bash
fsmove@b7b5bca1a9df:~$ ./scripts/analyze-traces.sh traces
```
When this script terminates
(it takes roughly 10-20 minutes),
you can exit container and
inspect the analysis results
stored in `traces/` directory.
The script also generates the `traces/faults.csv` file
which gives a summary of fault detection results.
